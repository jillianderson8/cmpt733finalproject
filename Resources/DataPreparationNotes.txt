We identified that the location of trees in the shapefile and the actual image
did not align. Locations seemed to differ consistently within small regions
but not consistently over the entire image. So we examined the differences over
the image. We found that points needed to be shifted: 
	* Top Right ~> 30 pixels to the left, 70 down 
	* Top Left ~> 30 pixels to the right, 60 down
	* Bottom Left ~> 30 pixels to the right, 30 down
	* Bottom Right ~> 30 px left, 30 px down
	* Center ~> 40 px down

From this we generated two transformation functions: 
	* x_new = x + (60x/w - 30)
	* y_new = y + (-30y/h + 60)
